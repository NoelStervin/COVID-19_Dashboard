# COVID-19_Dashboard

## Overview

This project leverages Power BI to explore and visualize COVID-19 data from a rich dataset encompassing various tables. The data offers insights at global, country, and even state/province levels.

Our analysis focuses on key metrics like confirmed cases, fatalities, recoveries, and how these trends evolve over time. The data incorporates details of global statistics and individual country-wise breakdowns.

## Data Preparation

The initial stage involved cleaning the data to eliminate duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant columns. We then enriched the dataset by calculating mortality and recovery rates, along with active cases. Additionally, measures were created to track daily changes in cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Building the Data Model

To establish meaningful relationships between the tables, a data model was designed. This model utilizes common identifiers like country/region and date as keys. Hierarchies and sorted data fields were also implemented to enhance navigation and analysis within Power BI.

## Visual Storytelling

A variety of visualisations were employed to effectively communicate COVID-19 trends and critical metrics. These include line charts, bar charts, and pie charts. Our visualisations track confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time, both globally and for individual countries. Comparisons between different countries and regions further illuminate the variations in COVID-19's impact. Daily new cases, deaths, and recoveries are analyzed to understand the spread and impact of the virus on an ongoing basis.

## Extracting Insights

The analysis goes beyond simply displaying data. We delve into the trends, including:

Visualizing confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time (globally).

Comparing key metrics across different countries.

Analyzing daily changes in cases, deaths, and recoveries.

Calculating and visualizing mortality and recovery rates.

Utilizing visuals to monitor active cases, total confirmed cases, total deaths, and total recoveries.

### By combining data exploration with visual storytelling, this project sheds light on the global picture of COVID-19 and its variations across regions.
